# Basic-C ypress

Simple project developed by Talking About Testing where you can test different functions and learn different Cypress commands

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js, npm and Git installed to run this project.

> I used versions Node.js `v22.12.0`, npm `10.9.0` and Git `2.47.1`. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

There are two ways to run the tests: desktop mode and mobile mode

## Desktop Mode

Run `npm test` to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open Cypress in interactive mode.

## Mobile Mode

Run `npm test:mobile` to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run `npm run cy:open:mobile` to open Cypress in interactive mode.
